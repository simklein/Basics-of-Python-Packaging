# Basics of Python
An attempt of summarizing information on how to get started with python and the basics of python packaging. These notebooks are meant to cover all basic information needed for the development of the [ITA Toolbox](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/mbe/haiopy) in Python. Feel free to add content.

## Getting Started
The Jupyter notebooks are available

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/simklein/basics-of-python/blob/master/index.ipynb) 
* Online for [interactive use](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simklein/basics-of-python/master?filepath=index.ipynb) using [binder](http://mybinder.org/)
* Local (offline) use on your computer

If you want to use the notebooks on your own computer, you will need a local Jupyter/IPython installation. Check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Use 'git clone' for a local version of this repo to add anything.
