# Basics of Python [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simklein/basics-of-python/master?filepath=index.ipynb)
This is an attempt of collecting and summarizing knowledge on Python and Python packaging. The collection of Jupyter Notebooks are meant to cover all basic information needed for the development of the [ITA Toolbox](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/mbe/haiopy) in Python.  
**Feel free to add any useful content.**

## Getting Started
The Jupyter Notebooks are available

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/simklein/basics-of-python/blob/master/index.ipynb) 
* Online for [interactive use](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simklein/basics-of-python/master?filepath=index.ipynb) using [binder](http://mybinder.org/)
* Local (offline) use on your computer

If you want to use the notebooks on your own computer, you will need a local Jupyter/IPython installation. If you don't have it installed jump to the [Anaconda](#anaconda) section. 
For a local version of this repo clone it with git. 
```
git clone https://github.com/simklein/basics-of-python.git
``` 


## Anaconda
Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for setting up Python the first time. Anaconda is a distribution of Python that comes with several packages, an IDE and a virtual environment manager.
